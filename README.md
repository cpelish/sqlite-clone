# sqlite-clone

This repository is me following along with https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/
Note: it appears this tutorial was never finished, so I'm stopping here for now.

To compile:
```bash
gcc -Wall db.c -o db
```

It's easiest to install rspec with `gem install`, but your package manager might have it as well.

To test:
```bash
bin/rspec db.rspec
```
